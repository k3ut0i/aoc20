* Implementation Notes for AOC2020

** Day 1

*** Part 1
 I struggled to create a 2d matrix of pairs, but realized that I do not actually need both the elements. I just need their product.
 #+begin_src gnu-apl
   a←1721 979 366 299 675 1456
   a1←a∘.+a ⍝a1 has sums
   a2←a∘.×a ⍝a2 has product
   (2020=∊a1)/∊a2
 #+end_src

 I also took a lot of time to figure out I/O ~⎕FIO~ and string->number conversion with ~⍎~ and even more to combine them. Here is the whole process
 #+begin_src gnu-apl
   a←⍎⎕FIO[49]'inputs/day1'
   a1←a∘.+a
   a2←a∘.×a
   (2020=∊a1)/∊a2
 #+end_src
*** Part 2
 The simple combinatorial explosion below, that worked till now is not working for the input
 #+begin_src gnu-apl
   a←1721 979 366 299 675 1456
   as←a∘.+a∘.+a
   am←a∘.×a∘.×a
   (2020=∊as)/(∊am)
 #+end_src
 /GNU APL/ is complaining about a ~WS FULL+~ error. So now I need to get smart. Sorting and constraints?
